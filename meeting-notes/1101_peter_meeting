Need to add on top of ZigBee
- Adding reliability with the marshalling/unmarshalling process
- Error coding
- Adding redundancy on the network
    - If you get X/Y packets, you are able to decode
    - B/c we have a central node
    - Won't work if ZigBee is super reliable

- Adding 'relays' to the network
    - A -> B <- C
    - B needs to extrapolate packets from A and C

- Think about ZigBee vs WiFi
- Hardware requireemnts for ZigBee

Steps:
1) Collect hardware requirements
2) Improvement to idea

Survey Commentary
- Focus on changes in *techniques* used in the standards
- i.e. interest in using WiFi in *lower frequency bands*
- Talk about advantages of using different techniques
    - Different problems/requirements:
        - Unused spectrum
        - Power consumption
        - Lower Range
- Cherry pick sections from papers

- Top down approach
    - Requirements -> Changing technologies -> Light on details

- Professor will pick
