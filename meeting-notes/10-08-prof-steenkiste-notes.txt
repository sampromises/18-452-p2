Detect kind of wireless protocol
Data layer -> encrypted
Physical layer -> 

Plug-and-play
- auto configuration of things

What kind of standard protocols do these IoT devices use to 'announce' themselves?

Paper using DNS lookups and ML to discover type of device
- Not sure if home IoT devices would have DNS names

Challenge: How to discover these devices?
More points:
- Localizing these devices?

At this point:
- Look at research papers to see what can be done
    - If close enough to where we want to go, then can skim thru the research papers to see direction
- Lookup "IoT discovery protocols"
    - Most of home networks are WiFi
    - Usually a broadcast
