# What we've done so far
- Initial setup with just 1 Raspberry Pi

# Poster session
- Do something similar to P1
- Motivate challenges of hospital environment

# Moving forward
- Relay hopping

Not focus on performance,
focus on comparing protocols (e.g. TDMA vs CSMA)

# Due Wednesday (11/28),
Proposal with detailed milestones

# Potentially, stay longer past next Friday to get extra Pis

# How many Pis?
- The more the merrier
- 6 is an absolute minimum
